# Greedy-Algorithm---Minimum-Coins-for-Change-C-Implementation-
This program calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a specific amount of change (in cents). It follows a greedy algorithm, always selecting the highest possible denomination first.

Features:
âœ… User Input Validation â€“ Ensures the input is a non-negative integer.
âœ… Greedy Approach â€“ Uses the largest possible coin value first.
âœ… Optimized for U.S. Currency â€“ Considers:
Quarters (25 cents)
Dimes (10 cents)
Nickels (5 cents)
Pennies (1 cent)
âœ… Outputs the Minimum Number of Coins Needed

How It Works:
1. Takes user input (ensuring itâ€™s non-negative).
2. Iterates through the largest coin denominations, subtracting from the total and counting coins.
3. Displays the minimum number of coins required.

What I Learned:
ðŸ“Œ Using loops and conditions to implement a greedy algorithm.
ðŸ“Œ Ensuring input validation in C.
ðŸ“Œ Optimizing mathematical operations for efficiency.
