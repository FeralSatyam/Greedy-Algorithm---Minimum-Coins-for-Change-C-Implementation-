# Greedy-Algorithm---Minimum-Coins-for-Change-C-Implementation-
This program calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a specific amount of change (in cents). It follows a greedy algorithm, always selecting the highest possible denomination first.

Features:
✅ User Input Validation – Ensures the input is a non-negative integer.
✅ Greedy Approach – Uses the largest possible coin value first.
✅ Optimized for U.S. Currency – Considers:
Quarters (25 cents)
Dimes (10 cents)
Nickels (5 cents)
Pennies (1 cent)
✅ Outputs the Minimum Number of Coins Needed

How It Works:
1. Takes user input (ensuring it’s non-negative).
2. Iterates through the largest coin denominations, subtracting from the total and counting coins.
3. Displays the minimum number of coins required.
